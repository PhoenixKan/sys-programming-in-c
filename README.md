## Welcome to my bomb and funny repo - System Programming in C

You can use the files in each directory to see how to implement the examples described by the name of the directory.

If you are interested in contributin to this repository, feel free to fork, do the changes and make a pull request

The site was built using html and CSS only. Focus on the material if you are here to learn...I was just tired when I wrote it.
You can help me make it beautiful.
